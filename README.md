# Priorities

Welcome to the Priorities Gem! 

Prospective home buyer? Looking to move to a new city? This gem will help you narrow down your city search based on your personal criteria (budget, politics, safety, education, etc.)

'Priorities' sources its data from the following sites:
https://datausa.io
http://worldpopulationreview.com
http://www.city-data.com
http://www.geostat.org
http://www.areavibes.com

NOTES:
Because the data sourcing is reliant on scraping, checking a priority against 40+ cities can take over a minute.  This gem is a working prototype that can be easily modified and expanded and, in final implementation as an app, is not intended to be fully reliant on web-scraping.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'priorities'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install priorities
